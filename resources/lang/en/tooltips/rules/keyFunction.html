<p>A process can be identified either by it's name e.g. "apache" or by the complete command line, which includes all parameters used to start the process, e.g. "/usr/sbin/apache2 -k start"</p>

<p>To be alerted about a crashed processes choosing "by name" is the best option. If you run the same process multiple times but with different parameters and you want to monitor them separately choose "by command line".</p>

<p>Be aware that with java processes almost always the process name is just "java" and the real name of your program, e.g. the jar-file is a parameter. So choose "by command line" to correctly monitor java processes.
